# Moar work-sample

This is the generator for the work-sample tests for Netflix & SourceDNA.

Results are in the dist folder.

If you want to run this locally (assuming you already have node & npm):

```bash
npm install
npm run
```

This'll start up all the machinery & open your browser to the home page.  Pick your company to see the work sample.  There's a bunch of ES6 stuff in here, so better use Chrome.

I'll try to get things up and running on github pages, but no promises*.

## SourceDNA

Data's in .gitignore, so you'll need to clone this and unzip the data into `sdna/data`.  Everything should work after that.



\* But I thought you said there was ES6 stuff, hyuk hyuk
